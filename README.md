# assirepo
This repository was created for a GitHub assignment.

It contains a sample file (`hello.txt.txt`) that was uploaded using Git Bash to demonstrate basic Git commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.

The goal of the assignment was to learn how to:
- Create a repository on GitHub
- Clone it locally using Git Bash
- Upload a file
- Push changes to GitHub
